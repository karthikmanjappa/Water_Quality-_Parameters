#### Project Tittle 
#### Water Quality-Parameters
#### Project Description
#### The proposed methodology aims to develop a machine learning model for water quality assessment based on a dataset containing seven features:pH,Temperature (°C),Turbidity (NTU),Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L),Conductivity (µS/cm) And Wqi.Water is among the most precious resources on which all existence is dependent. Water contamination degrades water quality, impacting the health of sea creatures and, by extension, humans that use them.

#### Material And Methods
#### The aim of this study is the prediction of water quality components using ML(Machine Learning) techniques including Classification, SVM,Bagging and boosting group method of data handling (GMDH). Therefore, in the first part of this section, the studied area is introduced and then ranges of measured water quality components are presented. Overviews on applied AI models are then presented.

#### Conclusion 
#### Water quality is vital for sustaining life and must meet specific standards depending on its intended use (drinking, recreation, or ecosystem health). Regular monitoring of key parameters such as pH, DO, turbidity, and nutrient levels can help detect pollution sources and assess the effectiveness of water treatment processes. High-quality water should be clear, well-oxygenated, and free from harmful levels of chemicals and pathogens.
